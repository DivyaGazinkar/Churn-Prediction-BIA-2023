This capstone project, completed as part of my studies at the Boston Institute of Analytics, focuses on Telco customer churn prediction. 

The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that can identify customers at risk of churning, helping the company take proactive measures to retain valuable customers. 

The project includes Exploratory data analysis (EDA), Hypothesis Testing, Data Preprocessing, Machine Learning Model and Evaluations, and visualization by Power BI Dashboard.

This repository contains the code, dataset, and power bi dashboard used for the project.
